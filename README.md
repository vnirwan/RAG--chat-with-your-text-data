# RAG--chat-with-your-unstructured-data
News_langchain: This file demonstrates the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technique, reading data from a text file to answer user questions. It explores two methods: using VectorDB's similarity search and OpenAI's LLM. The text file contains news article data.
Read_unstructured_data: This file illustrates how to read data from various unstructured sources, including PowerPoint presentations, HTML files, and more. It also integrates a RAG pipeline, allowing users to interact with the data through natural language queries. Uses AI_Ethics_Unilever.html and Presentation.pptx as examples.
